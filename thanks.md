This page is for thanking the amazing people I met in my life.

I have a lot of great memories of the wonderful people I've met and I hope to keep these memories forever. Here is a list of the people I met in my life. I've been blessed to meet many wonderful people that I am very grateful for.

The list starts with the people I went to school with and includes some people I worked with and some people I just met.

My parents and my closest friends - Thank you for teaching me the greatest lessons of life. I wouldn't be the person I am today if it weren't for you.
