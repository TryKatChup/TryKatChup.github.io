In September 2021 I was invited to NanoCon to talk about cybersecurity in hospitals and data anonymization.

The main topics were:

- cybersecurity applications in healthcare;
- main attacks and their consequences;
- data breaches;
- countermeasures and best practices to avoid cyberattacks;
- why data anonymization is important.
