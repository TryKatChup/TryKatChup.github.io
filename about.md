## About

I live and study Computer Engineering in the motherland of lasagne, tortellini and tagliatelle al ragù.
<br>
Despite my love for Italian food and coding, I hate spaghetti code.
<br>
<br>
I am really interested in every field concerning computer science, from games and application development, to IT security, in my opinion fundamental nowadays. 
<br>
<br>
An environment that is fascinating me is the Artificial Intelligence one: I want to discover every single grain of its composition. 
<br>
<br>
I am really driven by curiosity, which makes me overcome anything.
<br>
My code is the representation of creativity taking form.
<br>
Through a keyboard and with a thirst of knowledge I hope my software could revolutionize the world.
<br>
<br>
I am black belt in karate and I have practiced it for almost 10 years.
<br>
I really love this discipline: it doesn't teach you only how to fight back, but it's also an opportunity for inner development and personal growth.
<br>
<br>
In my spare time I love giving life to drawings: I enjoy doing portraits of people and animals (I'm self taught).
<br>
Music is a great part of my life: I listen to a lot of genres, like metal, rock, blues, jazz, classical.
<br>
I love going to concerts too: it's an opportunity to live the music and for exchange opinions about the powerful emotion that songs can give us.
